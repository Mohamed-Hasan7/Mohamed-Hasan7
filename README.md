My name is @Mohamed-Hasan7 and I'm a learning software engineer. I'm excited to be part of the GitHub community!

I'm currently focusing on improving my skills in software development and computer science fundamentals. Some of the technologies I'm learning include Python, JavaScript, and Java.

In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with with fl studio. I'm also interested in machine learning and AI, and hope to work on some projects using TensorFlow in the future.

As I continue learning, I look forward to collaborating with others on open source projects. Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to code together! I'm always open to learning from more experienced developers.

Outside of tech, I enjoy staying active by watching and playing football. I also love reading fiction novels and listening to podcasts about startups and entrepreneurship. Self-improvement is important to me, so I'm always striving to level up my skills and knowledge.

Thanks for stopping by my GitHub! I look forward to contributing more to the community.
